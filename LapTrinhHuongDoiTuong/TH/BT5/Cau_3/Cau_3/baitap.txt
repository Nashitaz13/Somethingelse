i prefer live in dorm. there is no rule or no one to tell you what to do. the best advantage of living in dorm is security. living in the dorm gives me a safe environment to live and study. on society, there are many kinds of people, so living in dorm can restrain you from meeting bad guys, criminals. i dont have to worry about buying food and cook, everything becomes more comfortable and i just concentrate on my study. thats very wonderful!
